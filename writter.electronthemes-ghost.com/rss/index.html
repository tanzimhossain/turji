Publish your work on a custom domain, invite your audience to subscribe, send them new content by email newsletter, and offer premium subscriptions to generate sustainable recurring revenue to fund your work. </p><p>Ghost is an independent, open source app, which means you can customize absolutely everything. Inside the admin area, you&apos;ll find straightforward controls for changing themes, colors, navigation, logos and settings &#x2014; so you can set your site up just how you like it. No technical knowledge required.</p><p>If you&apos;re feeling a little more adventurous, there&apos;s really no limit to what&apos;s possible. With just a little bit of HTML and CSS you can modify or build your very own theme from scratch, or connect to Zapier to explore advanced integrations. Advanced developers can go even further and build entirely custom workflows using the Ghost API.</p><p>This level of customization means that Ghost grows with you. It&apos;s easy to get started, but there&apos;s always another level of what&apos;s possible. So, you won&apos;t find yourself outgrowing the app in a few months time and wishing you&apos;d chosen something more powerful!</p><hr><p>For now, you&apos;re probably just wondering what to do first. To help get you going as quickly as possible, we&apos;ve populated your site with starter content (like this post!) covering all the key concepts and features of the product.</p><p>You&apos;ll find an outline of all the different topics below, with links to each section so you can explore the parts that interest you most.</p><p>Once you&apos;re ready to begin publishing and want to clear out these starter posts, you can delete the &quot;Ghost&quot; staff user. Deleting an author will automatically remove all of their posts, leaving you with a clean blank canvas.</p><h2 id="your-guide-to-ghost">Your guide to Ghost</h2><ul><li><a href="https://writter.electronthemes-ghost.com/design/">Customizing your brand and site settings</a></li><li><a href="https://writter.electronthemes-ghost.com/write/">Writing &amp; managing content, an advanced guide for creators</a></li><li><a href="https://writter.electronthemes-ghost.com/portal/">Building your audience with subscriber signups</a></li><li><a href="https://writter.electronthemes-ghost.com/sell/">Selling premium memberships with recurring revenue</a></li><li><a href="https://writter.electronthemes-ghost.com/grow/">How to grow your business around an audience</a></li><li><a href="https://writter.electronthemes-ghost.com/integrations/">Setting up custom integrations and apps</a></li></ul><p>If you get through all those and you&apos;re hungry for more, you can find an extensive library of content for creators over on <a href="https://ghost.org/blog/">the Ghost blog</a>.</p><hr><h2 id="getting-help">Getting help</h2><p>If you need help, <a href="https://ghost.org/pricing/">Ghost(Pro)</a> customers can always reach our full-time support team by clicking on the <em>Ghost(Pro)</em> link inside their admin panel.</p><p>If you&apos;re a developer working with the codebase in a self-managed install, check out our <a href="https://forum.ghost.org">developer community forum</a> to chat with other users.</p><p>Have fun!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Customizing your brand and design settings]]></title><description><![CDATA[How to tweak a few settings in Ghost to transform your site from a generic template to a custom brand with style and personality.]]></description><link>https://writter.electronthemes-ghost.com/design/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">608ed49b61489313bcc39cc9</guid><category><![CDATA[Getting Started]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Ghost]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 02 May 2021 16:34:39 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/publishing-options.png" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/publishing-options.png" alt="Customizing your brand and design settings"><p>As discussed in the <a href="https://writter.electronthemes-ghost.com/welcome/">introduction</a> post, one of the best things about Ghost is just how much you can customize to turn your site into something unique. Everything about your layout and design can be changed, so you&apos;re not stuck with yet another clone of a social network profile.</p><p>How far you want to go with customization is completely up to you, there&apos;s no right or wrong approach! The majority of people use one of Ghost&apos;s built-in themes to get started, and then progress to something more bespoke later on as their site grows. </p><p>The best way to get started is with Ghost&apos;s branding settings, where you can set up colors, images and logos to fit with your brand.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/brandsettings.png" class="kg-image" alt="Customizing your brand and design settings" loading="lazy" width="3456" height="2338"><figcaption>Ghost Admin &#x2192; Settings &#x2192; Branding</figcaption></figure><p>Any Ghost theme that&apos;s up to date and compatible with Ghost 4.0 and higher will reflect your branding settings in the preview window, so you can see what your site will look like as you experiment with different options.</p><p>When selecting an accent color, try to choose something which will contrast well with white text. Many themes will use your accent color as the background for buttons, headers and navigational elements. Vibrant colors with a darker hue tend to work best, as a general rule.</p><h2 id="installing-ghost-themes">Installing Ghost themes</h2><p>By default, new sites are created with Ghost&apos;s friendly publication theme, called Casper. Everything in Casper is optimized to work for the most common types of blog, newsletter and publication that people create with Ghost &#x2014; so it&apos;s a perfect place to start.</p><p>However, there are hundreds of different themes available to install, so you can pick out a look and feel that suits you best.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/themesettings.png" class="kg-image" alt="Customizing your brand and design settings" loading="lazy" width="3208" height="1618"><figcaption>Ghost Admin &#x2192; Settings &#x2192; Theme</figcaption></figure><p>Inside Ghost&apos;s theme settings you&apos;ll find 4 more official themes that can be directly installed and activated. Each theme is suited to slightly different use-cases.</p><ul><li><strong>Casper</strong> <em>(default)</em> &#x2014; Made for all sorts of blogs and newsletters</li><li><strong>Edition</strong> &#x2014; A beautiful minimal template for newsletter authors</li><li><strong>Alto</strong> &#x2014; A slick news/magazine style design for creators</li><li><strong>London</strong> &#x2014; A light photography theme with a bold grid</li><li><strong>Ease</strong> &#x2014; A library theme for organizing large content archives</li></ul><p>And if none of those feel quite right, head on over to the <a href="https://ghost.org/themes/">Ghost Marketplace</a>, where you&apos;ll find a huge variety of both free and premium themes.</p><h2 id="building-something-custom">Building something custom</h2><p>Finally, if you want something completely bespoke for your site, you can always build a custom theme from scratch and upload it to your site.</p><p>Ghost&apos;s theming template files are very easy to work with, and can be picked up in the space of a few hours by anyone who has just a little bit of knowledge of HTML and CSS. Templates from other platforms can also be ported to Ghost with relatively little effort.</p><p>If you want to take a quick look at the theme syntax to see what it&apos;s like, you can <a href="https://github.com/tryghost/casper/">browse through the files of the default Casper theme</a>. We&apos;ve added tons of inline code comments to make it easy to learn, and the structure is very readable.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-code-card"><pre><code class="language-handlebars">{{#post}}

Don&apos;t let its minimal looks fool you, though, beneath the surface lies a powerful editing toolset designed to accommodate the extensive needs of modern creators.</p><p>For many, the base canvas of the Ghost editor will feel familiar. You can start writing as you would expect, highlight content to access the toolbar you would expect, and generally use all of the keyboard shortcuts you would expect.</p><p>Our main focus in building the Ghost editor is to try and make as many things that you hope/expect might work: actually work. </p><ul><li>You can copy and paste raw content from web pages, and Ghost will do its best to correctly preserve the formatting. </li><li>Pasting an image from your clipboard will upload inline.</li><li>Pasting a social media URL will automatically create an embed.</li><li>Highlight a word in the editor and paste a URL from your clipboard on top: Ghost will turn it into a link.</li><li>You can also paste (or write!) Markdown and Ghost will usually be able to auto-convert it into fully editable, formatted content.</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/editor.png" class="kg-image" alt="Writing and managing content in Ghost, an advanced guide" loading="lazy" width="3182" height="1500"><figcaption>The Ghost editor. Also available in dark-mode, for late night writing sessions.</figcaption></figure><p>The goal, as much as possible, is for things to work so that you don&apos;t have to <em>think</em> so much about the editor. You won&apos;t find any disastrous &quot;block builders&quot; here, where you have to open 6 submenus and choose from 18 different but identical alignment options. That&apos;s not what Ghost is about.</p><p>What you will find though, is dynamic cards which allow you to embed rich media into your posts and create beautifully laid out stories.</p><h2 id="using-cards">Using cards</h2><p>You can insert dynamic cards inside post content using the <code>+</code> button, which appears on new lines, or by typing <code>/</code> on a new line to trigger the card menu. Many of the choices are simple and intuitive, like bookmark cards, which allow you to create rich links with embedded structured data:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://opensubscriptionplatforms.com/"><div class="kg-bookmark-content"><div class="kg-bookmark-title">Open Subscription Platforms</div><div class="kg-bookmark-description">A shared movement for independent subscription data.</div><div class="kg-bookmark-metadata"><img class="kg-bookmark-icon" src="https://opensubscriptionplatforms.com/images/favicon.png" alt="Writing and managing content in Ghost, an advanced guide"><span class="kg-bookmark-author">Open Subscription Platforms</span></div></div><div class="kg-bookmark-thumbnail"><img src="https://opensubscriptionplatforms.com/images/osp-card.png" alt="Writing and managing content in Ghost, an advanced guide"></div></a></figure><p>or embed cards which make it easy to insert content you want to share with your audience, from external services:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hmH3XMlms8E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><p>But, dig a little deeper, and you&apos;ll also find more advanced cards, like one that only shows up in email newsletters (great for personalized introductions) and a comprehensive set of specialized cards for different types of images and galleries.</p><blockquote>Once you &#xA0;start mixing text and image cards creatively, the whole narrative of the story changes. Suddenly, you&apos;re working in a new format.</blockquote><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full"><img src="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/andreas-selter-xSMqGH7gi6o-unsplash.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Writing and managing content in Ghost, an advanced guide" loading="lazy" width="6000" height="4000"></figure><p>As it turns out, sometimes pictures and a thousand words go together really well. Telling people a great story often has much more impact if they can feel, even for a moment, as though they were right there with you.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/andreas-selter-e4yK8QQlZa0-unsplash.jpg" width="4572" height="3048" loading="lazy" alt="Writing and managing content in Ghost, an advanced guide"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/steve-carter-Ixp4YhCKZkI-unsplash.jpg" width="4032" height="2268" loading="lazy" alt="Writing and managing content in Ghost, an advanced guide"></div></div></div></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/lukasz-szmigiel-jFCViYFYcus-unsplash.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Writing and managing content in Ghost, an advanced guide" loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1705"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/jd-mason-hPiEFq6-Eto-unsplash.jpg" width="5184" height="3888" loading="lazy" alt="Writing and managing content in Ghost, an advanced guide"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/jp-valery-OBpOP9GVH9U-unsplash.jpg" width="5472" height="3648" loading="lazy" alt="Writing and managing content in Ghost, an advanced guide"></div></div></div><figcaption>Peaceful places</figcaption></figure><p>Galleries and image cards can be combined in so many different ways &#x2014; the only limit is your imagination.</p><h2 id="build-workflows-with-snippets">Build workflows with snippets</h2><p>One of the most powerful features of the Ghost editor is the ability to create and re-use content snippets. If you&apos;ve ever used an email client with a concept of <em>saved replies</em> then this will be immediately intuitive.</p><p>To create a snippet, select a piece of content in the editor that you&apos;d like to re-use in future, then click on the snippet icon in the toolbar. Give your snippet a name, and you&apos;re all done. Now your snippet will be available from within the card menu, or you can search for it directly using the <code>/</code> command.</p><p>This works really well for saving images you might want to use often, like a company logo or team photo, links to resources you find yourself often linking to, or introductions and passages that you want to remember.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/createsnippet.png" class="kg-image" alt="Writing and managing content in Ghost, an advanced guide" loading="lazy" width="2282" height="1272"></figure><p>You can even build entire post templates or outlines to create a quick, re-usable workflow for publishing over time. Or build custom design elements for your post with an HTML card, and use a snippet to insert it.</p><p>Once you get a few useful snippets set up, it&apos;s difficult to go back to the old way of diving through media libraries and trawling for that one thing you know you used somewhere that one time.</p><hr><h2 id="publishing-and-newsletters-the-easy-way">Publishing and newsletters the easy way</h2><p>When you&apos;re ready to publish, Ghost makes it as simple as possible to deliver your new post to all your existing members. Just hit the <em>Preview</em> link and you&apos;ll get a chance to see what your content looks like on Web, Mobile, Email and Social.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/preview.png" class="kg-image" alt="Writing and managing content in Ghost, an advanced guide" loading="lazy" width="3166" height="2224"></figure><p>You can send yourself a test newsletter to make sure everything looks good in your email client, and then hit the <em>Publish</em> button to decide who to deliver it to.</p><p>Ghost comes with a streamlined, optimized email newsletter template that has settings built-in for you to customize the colors and typography. We&apos;ve spent countless hours refining the template to make sure it works great across all email clients, and performs well for email deliverability.</p><p>So, you don&apos;t need to fight the awful process of building a custom email template from scratch. It&apos;s all done already!</p><hr><p>The Ghost editor is powerful enough to do whatever you want it to do.

Rather than just endlessly posting and hoping someone is listening, you can track real signups against your work and have them subscribe to be notified of future posts. The feature that makes all this possible is called <em>Portal</em>.</p><p>Portal is an embedded interface for your audience to sign up to your site. It works on every Ghost site, with every theme, and for any type of publisher. </p><p>You can customize the design, content and settings of Portal to suit your site, whether you just want people to sign up to your newsletter &#x2014; or you&apos;re running a full premium publication with user sign-ins and private content.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/portalsettings.png" class="kg-image" alt="Building your audience with subscriber signups" loading="lazy" width="2924" height="1810"></figure><p>Once people sign up to your site, they&apos;ll receive an email confirmation with a link to click. The link acts as an automatic sign-in, so subscribers will be automatically signed-in to your site when they click on it. There are a couple of interesting angles to this:</p><p>Because subscribers are automatically able to sign in and out of your site as registered members: You can (optionally) restrict access to posts and pages depending on whether people are signed-in or not. So if you want to publish some posts for free, but keep some really great stuff for members-only, this can be a great draw to encourage people to sign up!</p><p>Ghost members sign in using email authentication links, so there are no passwords for people to set or forget. You can turn any list of email subscribers into a database of registered members who can sign in to your site. Like magic.</p><p>Portal makes all of this possible, and it appears by default as a floating button in the bottom-right corner of your site. When people are logged out, clicking it will open a sign-up/sign-in window. When members are logged in, clicking the Portal button will open the account menu where they can edit their name, email, and subscription settings.</p><p>The floating Portal button is completely optional. If you prefer, you can add manual links to your content, navigation, or theme to trigger it instead.</p><p>Like this! <a href="#/portal">Sign up here</a></p><hr><p>As you start to grow your registered audience, you&apos;ll be able to get a sense of who you&apos;re publishing <em>for</em> and where those people are coming <em>from</em>. Best of all: You&apos;ll have a straightforward, reliable way to connect with people who enjoy your work.</p><p>Social networks go in and out of fashion all the time.

Ghost has a number of different user roles for your team:</p><p><strong>Contributors</strong><br>This is the base user level in Ghost. Contributors can create and edit their own draft posts, but they are unable to edit drafts of others or publish posts. Contributors are <strong>untrusted</strong> users with the most basic access to your publication.</p><p><strong>Authors</strong><br>Authors are the 2nd user level in Ghost. Authors can write, edit and publish their own posts. Authors are <strong>trusted</strong> users. If you don&apos;t trust users to be allowed to publish their own posts, they should be set as Contributors.</p><p><strong>Editors</strong><br>Editors are the 3rd user level in Ghost. Editors can do everything that an Author can do, but they can also edit and publish the posts of others - as well as their own. Editors can also invite new Contributors &amp; Authors to the site.</p><p><strong>Administrators</strong><br>The top user level in Ghost is Administrator. Again, administrators can do everything that Authors and Editors can do, but they can also edit all site settings and data, not just content. Additionally, administrators have full access to invite, manage or remove any other user of the site.<br><br><strong>The Owner</strong><br>There is only ever one owner of a Ghost site. The owner is a special user which has all the same permissions as an Administrator, but with two exceptions: The Owner can never be deleted.

While this setting is enabled, all search engine optimisation features will be switched off to help keep your site under the radar.</p><p>Do remember though, this is <em>not</em> secure authentication. You shouldn&apos;t rely on this feature for protecting important private data. It&apos;s just a simple, shared pass-phrase for some very basic privacy.</p><hr><h1 id="invite-your-team">Invite your team </h1><p>Ghost has a number of different user roles for your team:</p><p><strong>Contributors</strong><br>This is the base user level in Ghost. Contributors can create and edit their own draft posts, but they are unable to edit drafts of others or publish posts. Contributors are <strong>untrusted</strong> users with the most basic access to your publication.</p><p><strong>Authors</strong><br>Authors are the 2nd user level in Ghost. Authors can write, edit &#xA0;and publish their own posts. Authors are <strong>trusted</strong> users. If you don&apos;t trust users to be allowed to publish their own posts, they should be set as Contributors.</p><p><strong>Editors</strong><br>Editors are the 3rd user level in Ghost. Editors can do everything that an Author can do, but they can also edit and publish the posts of others - as well as their own. Editors can also invite new Contributors+Authors to the site.</p><p><strong>Administrators</strong><br>The top user level in Ghost is Administrator. Again, administrators can do everything that Authors and Editors can do, but they can also edit all site settings and data, not just content. Additionally, administrators have full access to invite, manage or remove any other user of the site.<br><br><strong>The Owner</strong><br>There is only ever one owner of a Ghost site. The owner is a special user which has all the same permissions as an Administrator, but with two exceptions: The Owner can never be deleted. And in some circumstances the owner will have access to additional special settings if applicable. For example: billing details, if using <a href="https://ghost.org/pricing/"><strong>Ghost(Pro)</strong></a>.</p><blockquote><em>It&apos;s a good idea to ask all of your users to fill out their user profiles, including bio and social links. These will populate rich structured data for posts and generally create more opportunities for themes to fully populate their design.</em></blockquote><p>Next up: <a href="/organising-content/">Organising your content</a> </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Organising your content]]></title><description><![CDATA[Ghost has a flexible organisational taxonomy called tags which can be used to configure your site structure using dynamic routing.]]></description><link>https://writter.electronthemes-ghost.com/organising-content/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">608ed50561489313bcc39e2d</guid><category><![CDATA[Getting Started]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Enamul Haque]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 07:10:30 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://static.ghost.org/v2.0.0/images/organising-your-content.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://static.ghost.org/v2.0.0/images/organising-your-content.jpg" alt="Organising your content"><p>Ghost has a flexible organisational taxonomy called<strong> tags</strong> which can be used to configure your site structure using <strong>dynamic routing</strong>. </p><h1 id="basic-tagging">Basic Tagging</h1><p>You can think of tags like Gmail labels. By tagging posts with one or more keyword, you can organise articles into buckets of related content.</p><p>When you create content for your publication you can assign tags to help differentiate between categories of content. </p><p>For example you may tag some content with &#xA0;News and other content with Podcast, which would create two distinct categories of content listed on <code>/tag/news/</code> and <code>/tag/weather/</code>, respectively.</p><p>If you tag a post with both <code>News</code> <em>and</em> <code>Weather</code> - then it appears in both sections. Tag archives are like dedicated home-pages for each category of content that you have. They have their own pages, their own RSS feeds, and can support their own cover images and meta data.</p><h1 id="the-primary-tag">The primary tag</h1><p>Inside the Ghost editor, you can drag and drop tags into a specific order. The first tag in the list is always given the most importance, and some themes will only display the primary tag (the first tag in the list) by default. </p><blockquote><em><strong>News</strong>, Technology, Startup</em></blockquote><p>So you can add the most important tag which you want to show up in your theme, but also add related tags which are less important.</p><h1 id="private-tags">Private tags</h1><p>Sometimes you may want to assign a post a specific tag, but you don&apos;t necessarily want that tag appearing in the theme or creating an archive page. In Ghost, hashtags are private and can be used for special styling.</p><p>For example, if you sometimes publish posts with video content - you might want your theme to adapt and get rid of the sidebar for these posts, to give more space for an embedded video to fill the screen. In this case, you could use private tags to tell your theme what to do.</p><blockquote><em><strong>News</strong>, #video</em></blockquote><p>Here, the theme would assign the post publicly displayed tags of News - but it would also keep a private record of the post being tagged with #video. In your theme, you could then look for private tags conditionally and give them special formatting. </p><blockquote><em>You can find documentation for theme development techniques like this and many more over on Ghost&apos;s extensive <a href="https://themes.ghost.org/v2.0.0/docs">theme documentation</a>.</em></blockquote><h1 id="dynamic-routing">Dynamic Routing</h1><p>Dynamic routing gives you the ultimate freedom to build a custom publication to suit your needs. Routes are rules that map URL patterns to your content and templates. </p><p>For example, you may not want content tagged with <code>News</code> to exist on: <code>example.com/tag/news</code>. Instead, you want it to exist on <code>example.com/news</code> . </p><p>In this case you can use dynamic routes to create customised collections of content on your site. It&apos;s also possible to use multiple templates in your theme to render each content type differently.</p><p>There are lots of use cases for dynamic routing with Ghost, here are a few common examples: </p><ul><li>Setting a custom home page with its own template</li><li>Having separate content hubs for blog and podcast, that render differently, and have custom RSS feeds to support two types of content</li><li>Creating a founders column as a unique view, by filtering content created by specific authors</li><li>Including dates in permalinks for your posts</li><li>Setting posts to have a URL relative to their primary tag like <code>example.com/europe/story-title/</code><br></li></ul><blockquote><em>Dynamic routing can be configured in Ghost using <a href="http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">YAML</a> files. Read our dynamic routing <a href="https://docs.ghost.org/docs/dynamic-routing">documentation</a> for further details.</em></blockquote><p>You can further customise your site using <a href="/apps-integrations/">Apps &amp; Integrations</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apps & integrations]]></title><description><![CDATA[There are three primary ways to work with third-party services in Ghost: using Zapier, editing your theme, or using the Ghost API.]]></description><link>https://writter.electronthemes-ghost.com/apps-integrations/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">608ed50561489313bcc39e2c</guid><category><![CDATA[Getting Started]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Enamul Haque]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 07:10:29 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://static.ghost.org/v2.0.0/images/app-integrations.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Creating a custom theme]]></title><description><![CDATA[Ghost comes with a beautiful default theme called Casper, which is designed to be a clean, readable publication layout and can be easily adapted for most purposes.]]></description><link>https://writter.electronthemes-ghost.com/themes/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">608ed50561489313bcc39e2b</guid><category><![CDATA[Getting Started]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Enamul Haque]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 07:10:28 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://static.ghost.org/v2.0.0/images/creating-a-custom-theme.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://static.ghost.org/v2.0.0/images/creating-a-custom-theme.jpg" alt="Creating a custom theme"><p>Ghost comes with a beautiful default theme called Casper, which is designed to be a clean, readable publication layout and can be adapted for most purposes.
